This is a collection of models and their respective implementation code, intended to be pushed in with TS vr-engine.

Currently, there are some legacy models from manually resizing model renders via https://glb-scale-o-matic.glitch.me/ due to loading in unnecessarily huge. However, that method usually resulted in double the file size, so the files remain unmodified until a more reliable method is found. Another thing to note is that the models seem to be spawning in below the player despite having an appropriate origin point. This may be due to rendering scenes without placing the models in the ground-objects or sky-objects group.
